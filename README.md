## Biomarker data
<p>
Original: https://brunods10.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MIT_COVID/time_series_375_prerpocess_en.csv
</p>
<p>
There are multiple ways to group this data. I think using the first value is the most useful because it allows for more time to prepare. A test the day prior to discharge isn't very useful.
